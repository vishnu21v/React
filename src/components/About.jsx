        <p>
          I'm an AI / Data / Web enthusiast currently studying and building
          projects in React, Python, ML, and academic assignments (classification,
          KNN, decision trees, Flask apps, etc.). I like making things look clean
          and easy to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now I'm focusing on: React + Vite, REST APIs, and deploying small
          apps.
        </p>

    </section>
